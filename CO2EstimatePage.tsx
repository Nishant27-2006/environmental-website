      <h1>Understanding CO2 Emissions in Homes</h1>
      <p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from residential buildings are a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, impacting climate change. This page explores the sources, effects, and reduction strategies of CO2 emissions in homes.</p>
      
      <section>
    <h2>Sources of CO2 in Residential Buildings</h2>
    <p>CO2 emissions in homes originate from various sources, each contributing to the overall carbon footprint of residential living. These sources include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Energy Production:</strong> The burning of fossil fuels for electricity and heating is the largest contributor to home CO2 emissions. This includes the use of coal, natural gas, and oil for power generation and domestic heating systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Appliances and Equipment:</strong> Gas-powered appliances like stoves, heating systems, and dryers, along with inefficient electrical appliances, contribute significantly to CO2 output. Older appliances tend to be less energy-efficient and thus emit more CO2.</li>
      <li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> Decomposition of organic waste in landfills generates CO2, especially when waste management practices are not optimized. Inefficient waste disposal and lack of recycling efforts exacerbate this issue.</li>
      <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> The use of vehicles for commuting and domestic purposes also adds to the CO2 emissions linked to households, particularly in suburban areas where public transportation may be less accessible.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Impact of CO2 Emissions</h2>
    <p>Increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere contribute significantly to global warming, leading to long-term changes in climate patterns. The impact of these emissions is far-reaching and includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Elevated CO2 levels enhance the greenhouse effect, leading to higher global temperatures, altered weather patterns, and more frequent and severe weather events like hurricanes and droughts.</li>
      <li><strong>Rising Sea Levels:</strong> As global temperatures rise, polar ice caps and glaciers melt, leading to rising sea levels. This can result in flooding of coastal areas, threatening ecosystems and human settlements.</li>
      <li><strong>Loss of Biodiversity:</strong> Climate change affects wildlife and their habitats, leading to shifts in species distribution and, in some cases, extinction. It disrupts the delicate balance of ecosystems on which many species depend.</li>
      <li><strong>Human Health Risks:</strong> Climate change and air pollution associated with CO2 emissions can have direct and indirect health impacts, including respiratory problems, heatstroke, and the spread of infectious diseases.</li>
    </ul>
